Mechanics:

- Defeating enemies nets experience for the player. When the bar fills, the player levels up and the bar resets.
  levelling up adds pre-determined points to stats and refills health and mana. There is an algorithm that
  decides the amount of experience each zpmbie can give (based on the random attributes of the enemy). The amount
  experience required to level up doubles with each level.
- The health and mana globes reflect the percentage of health/mana the player currently has relative to their
  maximum amount of health/mana. There is also a health bar for the enemies that reflect their life points.
- There is one spell (Fireball) to use. This projectile will be active until it makes contact with an object

Ending Remarks:

	This was a rewarding project! I have learned a lot and gained a greater understanding of the amount of
work that is required to make games. I unfortunately had to cut off this project at 36 hours, but most of that
was just getting interactions and the UI correct. Armageddon Fighter has great potential. If given the
opportunity in CS 4650, I would change the controls to a controller, because I feel that this game would be
much more fun with the ease of moving the player around and not having to reach in different locations on the 
keyboard.
