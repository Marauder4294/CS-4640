Welcome to Armageddon Fighter!

Right now, this is definitely an alpha build! You can't die and the enemies can. Enemies can walk through
objects. Sometimes, the hero gets caught in colliders. There is also only one level, one hero, and one type
of enemy. That will change soon as I spent an extreme amount of time getting the basics down with point-and-
click controls (Diablo style RPGs are extremely time consuming to make). There are going to be at least 3
different levels, 3 heroes, four types of enemies, and one boss. Here is what you need to know.

To move: point and left-click
To melee attack: point and left-click on the enemy and the hero will attack when close enough
To block: right-click
To end blocking: release right-click

To exit game: Alt + F4
